## “Full-Stack” Blockchain-enabled Marketplace - Blockchains & their impact on Marketplaces’ Stack:

### Network of Users
- Increasing the level of trust either by playing the role of a **Crytographic Trusted** or by leveraging user reviews
- Improving the **Matching** between buyers and sellers
- Improving marketplace’s **UX/UI**

### Infrastructure Layer
- A protocol to exchange value or a **P2P Payment** infrastructure (Paypal/Stripe --> Cryptocurrency ERC20-Token)
- Data Exchange Protocol --> **Blockchain O2O Protocol**
- **Decentralized Hosting** platform (AWS or Azure cloud service provider).

### Data Layer: **Individually Owned & fully Authenticated**
- **Users's ID & Reputation**
- **Historial Transactions**
- **Goods/Services Data** transparently sold on the marketplaces.

**Data is immutable**, so it can’t be deleted or changed. Validation by network prevents fraud.

**Agreements**: Digitally signed **smart contracts**. Contracts are unbreakable. No intermediaries required, as smart contracts are executed automatically.

## Blockchain and AirBnB ($3–9BN by 2020*)
- **Booking**: Using blockchains, the government ID of both parties would be authenticated once by a technical provider, made available to the counterpart at the will of each user, and travelers would be able to trust and rely on any reviews published on the host’s page.
- **Payment**: Smart Contract
- **Review**: Reviews could also not disappear as Blockchains are tamper-proofs.

The Blockchain benefits from better incentive alignment by rewarding participants through Token Distribution + Token Appreciation, which current centralized marketplaces have not done.

> Technology can bridge **trust** by offering:
- **Identity Verification** — Who is this person and do I trust them?
- **Reviews** — Have others stayed here and do they like it? What do other hosts have to say about this guest?
- **Assurance** — If something happens, can I call on someone during my travels? If my home is a mess, will I be covered for my loss?

> Technology can offer greater **convenience** by facilitating:
- **Payments** — As a host, will I get the money for the stay? If I send money, can I be sure the listing exists and isn’t a fraud?
- **Messaging** — Can I easily communicate and reach out to the other party?
- **Transactions** — Did I buy the good or service? Did it reduce the burden of going back and forth multiple times?
