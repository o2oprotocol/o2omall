# O2OMall marketplace: 
O2O Mall - Online to Offline Marketplace SaaS Platform using Chatbot &amp; Blockchain Technology

## “Full-Stack” Blockchain-enabled Marketplace - Blockchains & their impact on Marketplaces’ Stack:

### Network of Users
- Increasing the level of trust either by playing the role of a **Crytographic Trusted** or by leveraging user reviews
- Improving the **Matching** between buyers and sellers
- Improving marketplace’s **UX/UI**

### Infrastructure Layer
- A protocol to exchange value or a **P2P Payment** infrastructure (Paypal/Stripe --> ERC20)
- Data Exchange Protocol --> **Blockchain O2O Protocol**
- **Decentralized Hosting** platform (AWS or Azure cloud service provider).

### Data Layer: **Individually Owned & fully Authenticated**
- **Users's ID & Reputation**
- **Historial Transactions**
- **Goods/Services Data** sold on the marketplaces.

## Blockchain and AirBnB ($3–9BN by 2020*)
- **Booking**: Using blockchains, the government ID of both parties would be authenticated once by a technical provider, made available to the counterpart at the will of each user, and travelers would be able to trust and rely on any reviews published on the host’s page.
- **Payment**: Smart Contract
- **Review**: Reviews could also not disappear as Blockchains are tamper-proofs.

The Blockchain benefits from better incentive alignment by rewarding participants through Token Distribution + Token Appreciation, which current centralized marketplaces have not done.
